# Churn Prediction System

A Machine Learning project that predicts which customers are likely to leave a service. This system helps businesses proactively identify and retain at-risk customers.

## Project Structure

- `data/` : Contains datasets used for training and testing.  
- `outputs/` : Model predictions, evaluation results, and visualizations.  
- `powerbi dashboards/` : Power BI files and exported dashboards for data visualization.  
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies required to run the project.  

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Churn prediction using ML models  
- Evaluation of model performance  
- Interactive dashboards with Power BI for insights  

## Power BI Dashboard Preview

Here’s a preview of the Power BI dashboards generated for this project:

![Dashboard 1](powerbi dashboards/dashboard1.png)  
![Dashboard 2](powerbi dashboards/FinalDashBoard.png)  

> Make sure the screenshots are saved in `powerbi dashboards/` folder with the same filenames.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vkoti6159/Churn_Prediction_System.git

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Preprocess the dataset and train the model using provided scripts.

Generate outputs and evaluation metrics in the outputs/ folder.

Open Power BI dashboards for visual insights.

✅ **Next step:**  
1. Export your dashboards as PNG files (e.g., `dashboard1.png`, `dashboard2.png`).  
2. Place them in the `powerbi dashboards/` folder.  
3. Push everything to GitHub, and the README will display them automatically.  

If you want, I can **also rewrite this README in a super-short “GitHub-ready” version** so it looks extra clean and professional. Do you want me to do that?
